"""Tests for the prepare-pr push_guard.py stale-base detection.

Verifies that the push_guard script (src/kiro_crew/builtin_skills/kirocrew-dev/
prepare-pr/scripts/push_guard.py) correctly refuses to push when:
- The branch has no common history with origin/<base> (orphan / disconnected)
- The commit count exceeds --max-ahead (implausibly many commits for a PR)
- The fetch of origin/<base> fails (network error → fail closed)

And allows push when the branch is a normal single-commit PR (1 commit ahead
of a fresh origin/<base> with shared history).

Regression test for the 2026-07-31 clobber incident: a force-push from a
worktree branched off kiki-trunk carried 114 duplicate commits.
